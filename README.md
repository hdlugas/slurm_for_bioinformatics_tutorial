# Slurm for Bioinformatics Tutorial

This repository is intended to be a tutorial for implementing common bioinformatics tasks with the job scheduler Slurm on a High-Performance Computing (HPC) cluster. This tutorial may be useful for anybody using Slurm as a job scheduler on an HPC cluster but is created with researchers using Wayne State University's HPC cluster (i.e. WSU's Grid) in mind.
